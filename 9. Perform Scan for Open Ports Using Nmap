1.Update Ubuntu and Install Required Packages:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install nmap -y
2. Scan for Open Ports Using Nmap:
● First, check for your system's IP address:
ip a
● Then, perform the port scan on the target IP (in this case,
10.10.10.6):
nmap -sV -p- 10.10.10.6 # Replace with your target IP address (e.g.,
eth0)
● The -sV option attempts to determine the version of the services
running on open ports.
● The -p- option tells Nmap to scan all ports.
● NOTE: REMOVE /24 FROM IP ADDRESS, /24 MEANS ALL
DEVICES.
