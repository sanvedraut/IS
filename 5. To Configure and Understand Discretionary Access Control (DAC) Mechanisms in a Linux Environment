1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
a) Create Files and Directories:
1. Open a terminal and create a directory for testing DAC
mechanisms:
mkdir dac_demo && cd dac_demo
2. Create a file named confidential.txt within the directory:
touch confidential.txt
b) Set Permissions Using chmod:
1. Use chmod to set permissions for the file. For example, restrict read
and write access to the file for the owner only:
chmod 600 confidential.txt
- This makes the file readable and writable only by the file's owner.
For WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you can run:
sudo chmod o-rx /home/username/dac_demo
c) Change File Ownership Using chown:
1. Add a new user (e.g., alice) and change the ownership of the file to
that user:
sudo adduser alice
sudo chown alice:alice confidential.txt
d) Log in as Alice:
1. Switch to the user alice and try to read the confidential.txt file:
su alice
cat confidential.txtFor WSL, if su does not work, use:
sudo -i -u alice
sudo su - alice
2. Verify that other users (such as the default user) cannot access the
file:
ls /home/atharv/dac_demo
Output:
ls: cannot access '/home/username/dac_demo': Permission denied
e) Results:
- Alice (the file owner) can access confidential.txt.
- Other users (e.g., the default user) cannot read or write to the file
due to the restrictive permissions (600).
