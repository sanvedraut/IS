1. Create a directory for keys and navigate to it:
mkdir key && cd key
2. Generate a private key (RSA algorithm) with AES256
encryption:
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -aes256
● You will be prompted to Enter a PEM pass phrase. Enter a
passphrase and remember it.
3. Generate the public key from the private key:
openssl rsa -pubout -in private.key -out public.key
● Enter the pass phrase for the private key when prompted.
4. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the private
key:
openssl req -new -key private.key -out user.csr
● Enter the pass phrase for the private key.● Fill out the Distinguished Name (DN) fields when prompted.
5. Create a self-signed certificate using the private key and CSR:
openssl req -x509 -key private.key -in user.csr -out user_cert.crt -days
365
● Enter the pass phrase for the private key.
● A warning may appear—ignore it.
6. Generate the Certificate Authority (CA) private key (with
AES256 encryption):
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key -aes256
● Enter a PEM pass phrase for the CA key and verify it.
7. Create the CA self-signed certificate:
openssl req -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 3650
● Enter the pass phrase for the CA key when prompted.
● Fill out the Distinguished Name (DN) fields when prompted.
