1. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
a) Create Files and Directories:
1. Open a terminal and create a directory for testing MAC
mechanisms:
mkdir mac_demo && cd mac_demo
2. Create a file named confidential.txt:
touch confidential.txt
b) Enable SELinux:
1. Check if SELinux is enabled by running:
getenforce
2. If SELinux is not enabled, you can enable it by running:
sudo setenforce 1
c) Apply Security Context to a File:
1. Verify the security context of the file using the ls -Z command:
ls -Z confidential.txt
d) Test Policy Enforcement:
1. Simulate unauthorized access by trying to access the file through a
user or process that lacks the required permissions. For example, you
might attempt to cat the file as a non-root user:
sudo cat confidential.txt
2. Check the SELinux logs to verify that the event was logged:
sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log
e) Results:- SELinux will deny access to unauthorized processes or users and
will log the event in the audit.log.
- Unauthorized processes or users will be denied access even if they
are the file owner.
