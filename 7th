7. To Configure and Understand Role-Based Access Control
(RBAC) Mechanisms in a Linux Environment
1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
a) Create Roles (Groups):
First, create a new group called managers:
sudo groupadd managers
1.
Then, add the user alice to the managers group:
sudo usermod -aG managers alice
2.
b) Set Permissions on a File:
Create a file named manager_notes.txt:
touch manager_notes.txt
1.
Change the file's group to managers:
sudo chown :managers manager_notes.txt
2.
Set the permissions on the file so that only the owner and group
members can read and write to it:sudo chmod 770 manager_notes.txt
3.
c) Test Access:
1. As Alice:
Switch to the alice user:
su alice
○
After testing access, exit from the alice user and return to the main
user:
exit
○
2. To Add a New User:
Add a new user (e.g., other_user):
sudo adduser <username>
○
3. As Another User:
Switch to the newly created user:
su <other_user/username>○
Try to access manager_notes.txt:
cat manager_notes.txt
○
d) Results:
● Access to manager_notes.txt is controlled by group
membership (role), not individual ownership. Only users in the
managers group will be able to read and write to the file.
